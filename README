Overview
========

The "Cochran" project communicated with Cochran Undersea Technology scuba
diving computers. Users who cannot or choose not to use Cochrans' Analyst
software have no choice but this software to download and change settings
on their dive computers. Analyst works only on Windows so Linux and Mac
users have no native software available from Cochran.

This project is currently in the experimental phase. I'm using it to 
develop the algorithms to communicate with and parse data from Cochran
dive computers. In the future this project will be able to change settings
on the dive computer.

Current State
=============

Function                       State
------------------------------ -------------------------------------------
Access to CAN and WAN files    Use the canfile program to decrypt extract,
                               parse and display dive data. Currently it
                               supports a wide range of files and current
                               DCs.

Download of data from DC       Use the "serial" program to download data
                               from DCs. This results in a binary blob of
                               log and profile data which can be parsed
                               using cochran_log.c and _sample.c files.

Changes to settings            This is the most dangerous function so it's
                               taking time to develop.
